### Build a Camera-Based Touch Sensor (8.5/10P)
* Hardware is assembled correctly
    * yep (1P)
* Bounding boxes around fingers are detected robustly, palm-rejection works
    * palm-recection does not work (-1.5P)
* Movement and taps can be distinguished and sent via DIPPID, making it compatible with the given Fittsâ€™ Law application
    * yep, really nice! (3P)
* Automatic calibration works
    * yep (1P)
* Documentation
    * nice (2P)
* It's Fitts' Law, not Fitt's Law!!1!1!!elf!!!
* cameraID would be better as commandline parameter

### Touch-based Text Input (9.5/10P)
* Detection of finger or stylus works
    * finger is not really detected (-0.5P)
* Input is captured and pre-processed reasonably
    * yep (2P)
* Reasonable approach for hand-writing recognition
    * yep (2P)
* Robust detection
    * yep (1P)
* Acceptable latency
    * yep (1P)
* Mapping of handwriting to keyboard
    * yep (1P)
* Documentation
    * yep (2P)


**You can add here a really nice comment about your work :)**
* could be a thumps up
* could be a "good job"
* could be a imaginary high five
